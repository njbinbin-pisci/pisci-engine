//! Agent lifecycle hooks.
//!
//! Hooks let a host observe and influence the agent loop without coupling the
//! kernel to any particular host capability. The kernel invokes these at fixed
//! extension points; a host supplies an [`AgentHooks`] implementation through
//! [`crate::agent::harness::config::HarnessConfig`].
//!
//! Design goals:
//! - **Optional**: the loop runs identically when no hooks are wired (`None`).
//! - **Cheap when unused**: default trait methods are no-ops.
//! - **General**: tool lifecycle (before/after) and context-management events
//!   are first-class, so hosts can build journaling, auditing, policy plugins,
//!   undo/replay, telemetry, etc. on top of the same surface.
//!
//! The first consumer is CodeZ's file journal, which snapshots file contents
//! before `file_write` / `file_edit` so the host can offer Cursor-style
//! "Undo All" / replay recovery.
