//! Pluggable agent-loop control strategy.
//!
//! Historically the agent loop hard-coded its ReAct control flow inline. This
//! trait lifts the *policy* decisions a host might want to vary — how the
//! request context is shaped before each call, whether to stop after a turn,
//! and which model / hints to use next — out of the loop so a host can supply
//! its own strategy (ReAct, Plan-and-Solve, Reflexion, …) without forking the
//! kernel.
//!
//! Boundary of responsibilities:
//! - **Strategy** decides loop-level *policy* at turn boundaries.
//! - **Loop** owns orchestration: LLM calls, tool execution, persistence,
//!   compaction, and event emission.
//!
//! Every method has a behaviour-preserving default, so wiring the built-in
//! [`ReActStrategy`] (or leaving the slot empty) changes nothing.
